grep is used to search a given file, and prints the lines that contain a given word or pattern.
grep takes two parameters: the first is what you want to search for and the second is what files you want to search through

Eg: grep a FileName.txt searched for all lines with the letter A in FileName.txt
Eg: grep binary *.txt (Only wanted to look at files with the word binary in them)
