cp can be used to copy a file or directory. 

To copy a file, cp takes 2 parameters: the name of the file you wish to copy, and the new name you'd like to give the copy.
  eg: cp origFileName newFileName

To copy a file into another directory, it also requires 2 parameters, separated by ~/
  eg: cp origFileName ~/destDirName

To copy a file into another directory and also rename it involves the above process, with the addition of a new file name.
  eg: cp origFileName ~/destDirName/newFileName
